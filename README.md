# spanish-olamundo

Home-brew spanish grammar course

## NOTES ABOUT DEV OF THIS STUFF

- Experience with access from Android Smartphone showed:

- Several smaller files are *MUCH* better than 1 big one, ..

- Android clogs up and croaks on files approaching 100kB

- So first major re-org was, cut the big md-text into:

(a) basic grammar but no vocab-builder / dictionary

(b) vocab-builder / dictionary

### IDEA FOR FUTURE

- maybe further split into a verb-builder section. ? think.
