Home-brew spanish grammar course

## NOTES ABOUT "DESIGN" LOL HAHA

- this is an ongoing experiment, but there were anticipated use-cases..

- altho the material has to be still useful *IN ABSENCE OF* net connection, ..

- it must nevertheless be based on a bunch of links to online material.

- I take the opinion that in this day and age, the web, just by itself, ..

- .. can serve as a language primer - no paper books are required anymore.

- Of course one pre-req will never change: immersion in conversation w locals.



## NOTES ABOUT DEV OF THIS STUFF

- Experience with access from Android Smartphone showed:

- Several smaller files are *MUCH* better than 1 big one, ..

- Android clogs up and croaks on files approaching 100kB

- So first major re-org was, cut the big md-text into:

(a) basic grammar but no vocab-builder / dictionary

(b) vocab-builder / dictionary

### IDEA FOR FUTURE

- maybe further split into a verb-builder section. ? think.
